# MeguKin

## Description of the Language

`MeguKin` aims to be a functional language with strong type system and 
static type check evolving from simple typed lambada calculus 
(aumented with tuples and maybe records),to a λω + type classes.

## Motivation

I want to learn about code generation for functional languages and 
others things.

The source of the first compiler and the target of compilation is python 
since I want to be able (more or less) to:
  - Get a functional compiler with ease in any platform.

## RoadMap

- Implement simple typed lambda calculus without syntax sugar, with
  tuples and iterpreted in python

- Add compilation to python

- Add records

- create a lsp for the language

- Maybe do more backends like C or wasm or even llvm

- Maybe Add indentation

- Add terms depending on types and types depending on types

- Add classes
